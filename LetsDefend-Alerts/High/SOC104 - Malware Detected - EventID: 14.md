<br>```üìú Introduction```
<p>On September 15, 2020, at 09:02 PM, a critical alert (SOC104) was triggered by our security monitoring systems, indicating the detection of potential malware. Malware attacks pose a significant threat in the cybersecurity realm, often designed to infiltrate systems, steal sensitive information, or disrupt operations. This specific incident involved a file named `googleupdate.exe` originating from the host `JohnComputer` with the IP address `172.16.17.82`. The file, which was allowed by the system, was identified by its hash `0bca3f16dd527b4150648ec1e36cb22a` and had a size of 152.45 KB. This writeup will explore the details of the alert, outlining the investigative steps taken to analyze the file, the techniques employed to determine its malicious nature, and the subsequent actions executed to neutralize the threat. Documenting such incidents is vital for enhancing our defense mechanisms and ensuring preparedness against future malware threats.</p>

<br>```üåê Step 1: Analyze the hash of the potential malware sample```
<p>When reviewing the description of the alert, we find a hash associated with a file <strong>.exe </strong> called <strong>googleupdate.exe</strong>. At first glance, it might look like a legitimate file related to a Google update, but in cybersecurity, we should never assume the benignity of a file without first performing a thorough analysis. Let's proceed to investigate this file in detail. First, we analyze the file hash on platforms like VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis. At VirusTotal, surprisingly, no Indicator of Compromise (IOC) was generated nor was any suspicious or malicious activity detected. This result could lead us to question the need for further investigation, but it is important to remember that the absence of detections does not guarantee the security of the file.

On the other hand, when reviewing the file in Hybrid Analysis, three results were obtained, of which one was marked as malicious. However, it is crucial to note that this result comes from a rapid analysis, which limits the reliability of this conclusion. A quick scan may miss certain malicious behavior or generate false positives, so it is not enough to conclusively determine whether the file is malicious or not. Therefore, a more detailed and in-depth analysis is required to reach an accurate conclusion about the nature of this file</p>

<br>```üåê Step 2: Analyze the file in a sandbox```
<p>To analyze this sample of possible malware whose hash is <strong>0bca3f16dd527b4150648ec1e36cb22a</strong>, we will use a free sandbox like Any.Run. This type of tool allows us to run the file in a controlled environment and observe its behavior in real time. Before proceeding with manual analysis, it is useful to check if there are previous reports on this hash. By entering the hash in Any.Run, we can observe multiple results, mainly in format .bin, but our interest is focused on the file with extension .exe. One of the results indicates, at a first glance, that no threats were detected in this file. However, to be sure, it is advisable to review the report in detail. Clicking on the report, we found that the file received a risk score of 10 out of 100, indicating a mild warning. This score corresponds to a behavior that was detected during the analysis: the executable file appears to drop another file upon startup.

It is important to note that, in Windows environments, it is common for certain files .exe They perform this action as part of their normal operation, and it does not necessarily indicate malicious activity. However, it is crucial not to ignore this warning and consider performing additional scans or using other tools to rule out any possible threats.</p>

<br>```üåê Step 3: Analyze the computer of user John Computer```
<p>When reviewing the events in the log management system, we observed that five events were logged, but none of them match the date the alert was activated. This could lead us to deduce that we are facing a false positive. However, before jumping to conclusions, it is prudent to investigate further. We decided to examine John's work machine directly to find out more. By reviewing his system, we confirmed that the program googleupdate.exe was run on your computer. However, based on everything we've analyzed up to this point‚Äîincluding the results of the scans in VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and the Any.Run sandbox‚Äîthere is no evidence to suggest that this file is malicious. It does not present typical malware behaviors or signs of being a threat to the system. Therefore, in this case, it appears that the alert was a false positive, and the program does not pose a security risk. </p>

<br>```üìã Conclusion```
<p><strong>What is the googleupdate.exe file?:</strong> The process googleupdate.exe It is a legitimate file used by Google to keep its software up to date. It is not a virus or malware, and does not pose a threat to your computer. However, some users might feel uncomfortable with this process as it runs in the background and consumes system resources. <strong>(Stelian Pilici. 2023)</strong></p>

- <p><strong>Define Threat Indicator:</strong> We will select the option: <strong>Unknown or unexpected services and applications configured to launch automatically on system boot</strong> This is because, in general, updates for various browsers are started automatically when a computer boots, which makes this situation</p>

- <p><strong>Check if the malware is quarantined/cleaned:</strong> As we saw earlier when investigating John's workstation, the quarantine option was not activated. Therefore, this potential <strong>malware is not quarantined.</strong></p>

- <p><strong>Analyze Malware:</strong> We can conclude that this program <strong>is not malicious.</strong></p>

- <p><strong>Close Alert:</strong> Finally, this alert turns out to be a <strong>false positive.</strong></p>
