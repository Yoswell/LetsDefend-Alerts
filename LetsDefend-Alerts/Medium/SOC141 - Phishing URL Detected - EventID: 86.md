<h3>üåê Step 1: URL Research </h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Determine the nature of the URL that has been reported in the alert.<br><br>
<strong>1 - URL review in Reputation Services:</strong><br>

<p><strong>2 - Domain Analysis:</strong><br>
In this alert we have a domain, which is "mogagrocol.ru", but when analyzing it in different tools they do not report anything about whether the domain is dangerous or malicious. Therefore we must perform a more exhaustive search for this alert.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Analyze the source of the alert:</strong><br>
We know that this alert comes from a user called "EmilyComp", with an IP assigned to her workstation "172.16.17.49", so let's start by going to the "Email Security" section and search for the name "Emily". This will return a result that we will click on. Once we click on this result, the email that Emily has received will open. Here we will find two things, a domain called "netflix-payments.com" and a URL "http://bit.ly/3ecXem52".</p>
